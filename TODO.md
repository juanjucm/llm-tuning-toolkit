## TODOs

- Finish implementation of basic benchmarking runs
    - Manage errors in benchmarking launch.
    - Log metadata (engine name, engine config, etc).
    - Manage same run-id for the same scenario.
    - Store results.

- Implement engine arg sweep -> this implies running multiple tests with the same engine.
- Implement custom benchmarks for extra functionalities: tool calling, reasoning, etc.
